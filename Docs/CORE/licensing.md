TOOLPATHS has two licensing options:

1.Cloud Zoo

This is used for individual licenses that are managed via CloudZoo. They can be used on all the machines where you logged in with your rhino account. They require perdiodically internet access. 

2.Local Licensing / Trail 

For organisations we can offer volume licensing that can run on multiple PCs. This is also used for the trail license
