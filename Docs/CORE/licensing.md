TOOLPATHS has two licensing options:

1. **Cloud Zoo**

   This option is intended for individual licenses managed via Cloud Zoo. You can use your license on any machine where you are signed in with your Rhino account. It requires an internet connection from time to time. 


2. **Local Licensing / Trial**

   This option is intended for organisations and supports volume licenses that can run on multiple PCs. It is also used for trial licenses
