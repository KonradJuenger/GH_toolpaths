# Toolpaths

## STILL IN DEVELOPMENT / NO CODE / NO PACKAGE

Toolpaths is a Grasshopper plugin for generating and simulating G-code. It's goal is to enable new ways of 3D printing and CNC milling while giving novices and experts alike  full control of the machines movement.



### Toolpaths principles

- Parameterized geometry
  A Toolpath groups a curve and its parameters into a single geometric object. This lets you vary settings like speed or extrusion per path or per segment. Because it stays a standard Grasshopper geometry, it can still be transformed by regular components.

- Progressive complexity
  Settings are optional and stay out of the way until you need them. A clear hierarchy lets you define values at three levels: Defaults (lowest), Toolpath, and Operation (highest). Set a global default once, override it on a few toolpaths, or apply changes to an entire operation without duplicating inputs.

- Accurate simulation
  FDM is simulated as real material accumulation in world space â€” overlapping paths are reflected in the result. CNC simulation models material removal with high resolution. Both focus on fidelity and performance to provide reliable previews before you generate G-code.
